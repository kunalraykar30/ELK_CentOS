# ELK - Installtion of ELK on the Cent OS 7 
This playbook works butter smooth with the VM instances of GCP. 
I cloned the git repo of the ELK on my GCP VM and then ran runsetup.yaml But please note You need to install git and ansible on GCP instance 

```
# yum install ansible 
# yum install git 
# ansible-playbook runsetup.yaml 
```
